# This is a post

Here is some test that is roughly a line. We will follow this text with a ul or
an ol to see how our formatting for _all the things_ works. And _all the things_
should appear italicized. But I doubt it will. And *this should be bold*.

## Unordered List Coming up

* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3

## Codeblock anyone?

> Hmmm... don't we love quotes?

```
def code_block
  if(true) do
    // something
  end
end
